        Why are website speed optimization services essential for the success of
        a website?
      </h2>
      <p className="font20 pb-[40px] phone:pb-[115px]">
        Simple! It's not just what your visitors want; it's also what Google
        wants. There is a link between page speed and SEO, which is why your
        pages must load quickly.
      </p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        Google's primary responsibility is to provide users with search results
        that are relevant to their queries. Not only do search engines want to
        show pages with content that best matches the user's query, but they
        also want to show websites that provide an excellent user experience.
        And, you guessed it, page speed is an important component of a positive
        user experience.
      </p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        Readability and ease of navigation are two other user experience
        factors.
      </p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        Pages that load quickly appeal to site visitors and reduce bounce rate —
        another indicator to Google of how good your site is.
      </p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        When your website takes longer than 3 seconds to fully load, users
        become frustrated and leave to find another that provides the
        information they require more quickly.
      </p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        If users consistently leave your site, Google will take notice, and your
        search engine rankings will drop. Because Google sees a link between a
        high bounce rate and a poor user experience, they will actually punish
        you in the rankings.
      </p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        Google observes that if users do not stay on your website long enough to
        read your content, it must not be a very good website. They (or your
        site visitors) have no idea that you could have one of the best websites
        with the best content available, but your slow load time prevented them
        from experiencing it.
      </p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        This shows the importance of page speed. Website speed can deter users
        from visiting your site in the first place, which means they won't learn
        about your company, see your products and services, or read your useful
        information. Most of the time, they will not convert.
      </p>
      <p className="font20Bold pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        Is there a mobile aspect?
      </p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        Google announced its Speed Update in January 2018, stating that mobile
        speed is now a ranking factor. As a result, site speed can affect both
        your desktop and mobile rankings.
      </p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        This means that when it comes to website speed optimization, it's
        critical to keep mobile in mind.
      </p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        Page speed optimization for mobile devices works in the same way that it
        does for desktop computers. Of course, you'll want to make sure your
        site is mobile-friendly in the first place! This means your website is
        effective and simple to use on smaller screens as well!
      </p>
      <p className="font20Bold pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        Why should you think about ongoing site speed optimization?
      </p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        Muscled has two main packages: initial and ongoing, but there are a few
        key reasons why you should consider ongoing page speed efforts:
      </p>

      <ol className="list-decimal pl-[30px] pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        <li className="font20">
          As Google and other search engines evolve, it is critical to the
          success of your website that site speed optimization is prioritized on
          an ongoing basis. Furthermore, site evolution — including plugin and
          CMS updates — necessitates regular page speed audits.
        </li>
        <li className="font20">
          Site speed optimization is a technical service that requires expert
          developers to devote time to uncovering hidden issues in code that may
          be slowing down your site.
        </li>
        <li className="font20">
          You'll most likely see larger gains initially and incremental gains
          over time, but small, incremental gains will keep your site's page
          speed under control.
