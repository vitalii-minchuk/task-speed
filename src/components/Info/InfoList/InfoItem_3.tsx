        The Advantages of Site Speed Optimization
      </h2>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        When considering site speed optimization, the following benefits come to
        mind:
      </p>
      <p className="font20Bold">Improved Google rankings</p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        Page speed is a ranking factor for Google, so it&lsquos critical that you
        keep your site optimized. When your site loads quickly for users, you
        have a better chance of ranking higher in search results because you
        provide a great user experience.
      </p>
      <p className="font20Bold">Users will spend more time on your website.</p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        Users will stay on your site longer if your pages load quickly because
        they get the instant gratification that they crave. This is also related
        to the following advantage.
      </p>
      <p className="font20Bold">Users will not visit competitor websites.</p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        One of the most common reasons users bounce to a competitor&lsquos site is
        that the site fails to load. There&lsquos no reason for users to visit a
        competitor&lsquos website if your site loads quickly and they can find the
        information they&lsquore looking for.

        Increased leads, conversions, and revenue over time
      </p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        When you keep up with your website speed optimization, you&lsquoll see an
        increase in leads, conversions, and revenue over time due to higher
        rankings, more site visitors staying on your site, and more.
