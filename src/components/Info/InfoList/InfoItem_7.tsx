      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        At Muscled , we truly think that you should have a single point of
        contact throughout the duration of your campaign. Why? That way, you&lsquoll
        always know who you&lsquore talking to. Your point of contact will be
        familiar with and understand your campaign, and you will not have to be
        moved to three different people to get an answer.
      </p>
      <p className="font20 pb-[20px] phone:pb-[40px]">
        We want to make sure you get the best service possible, so we make sure
        you have a point of contact who can answer any questions you have, keep
        you updated on your campaign, and so much more.
